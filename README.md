# Forecasting Chicago Rideshare Volume

The goal of this project was to take open source rideshare data collected by the city of Chicago, and apply machine learning techniques for analysis. In this project I perform a network analysis to visualize the data geographically, utilize louvain clustering to identify underlying community structures, and test performance of various time-series forecasting methods.

## Data Collection

All data was downloaded using the city of Chicago's Open Data Portal.

The data used included 65M+ rides from November to April 2019

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
